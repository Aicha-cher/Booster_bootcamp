# Practical programming for geoscientists

**Instructors:** [Evan Bianco](https://twitter.com/EvanBianco) and [Matt Hall](https://twitter.com/kwinkunks)

**When**:
May 11, 2017, 8:30 am - 4:00pm

**Where**:
geoLOGIC Classroom   540 5th Ave SW   Calgary, AB

**What**:
We will teach a hands-on introduction to the [Python](https://www.python.org/)
programming language.

This is a crash course in the fundamentals of programming and scientific computing with geoscience applications. We deliver the course by alternating short tutorials with hands-on programming exercises. Participants get practice with programming syntax by following along on their laptops. They receive the entire set of presentations, programs, and course data before the course starts, which amounts to a huge amount of working code that they'll be able to make use of by the end of the course. The course uses standard industry data such as well logs, horizons, and seismic to illustrate computational concepts we all encounter in our daily workflows. We teach using the Python programming language. It's a fantastic language for scientific computing. It is easy-to-learn, powerful, even if it does have a rather daunting ecosystem of thousands of open source code libraries. But fear not, we'll get you set up and well practiced with the handful of ones that you'll use the majority of the time.

**Bring**:
Participants must bring their own **computers** (Mac, Windows, or Linux) with the
required **software already installed** (see [What to install](what-to-install)
below). [Contact Evan and Matt](https://agilescientific.com/contact-us/) if you need any help **before**
the course. 


## Goals

- Get up and running with state of the art scientific computing software
- Learn the fundamentals of programming common to all programming languages.
- Exposure to general purpose power tools, and geoscience-specific Python code libraries
- Learn how and when to use other people's code, and when to write your own.
- Create stunning 2D and 3D visualizations and graphics that are reproducible, customizable, and transparent.
- Practice wrangling petroleum-specific digital data sets
- Define paths of continued learning and future projects

## What to install

There are many ways to get Python on your system and it can be very confusing
when you're first starting out.
I **don't** recommend downloading it from python.org or using the Python that
came with your system (common on Linux).
Instead, **use the Anaconda distribution**.
It will come with all the libraries you'll need and doesn't require
administrative access to install.

Go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads and select the **Python 3.6** version
of the installer for your system.
It's safe to use all the default configuration options when installing.

**Even if you already have Python** (say from your system package manager or
ArcGIS, etc), I recommend that you install Anaconda to avoid problems with
versioning.

You'll also need a **text editor**. If you don't already have one of your
choice, I recommend installing [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
(it's available for Linux, Windows, and Mac).

**Please install all software BEFORE coming to the course.** If you have any
problems installing or don't know which version you need to download, get in touch.

**WARNING** There's still a lot of Python 2 around. Keep away from it if you can! Python 3 has lots of advantages, and there are hardly any libraries now that have not made the swtich.

* [Learn everything about IPython and the Notebook!](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Index.ipynb) There's a lot to know, but some of it seems a bit un-Pythony to me.
